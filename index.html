    <h3>Local man sues White Water employee for splashing him with water</h3>
    <p>On August 8th, 2035 a man from Branson Missouri took himself and 3 sons to White Water.
        During this he recalls going on just about every ride they had there.
        So when we asked him if he was pretty wet from everything he stated "Yea I was absolutely soaked!"
        This throughout the chance that he had been trying to stay dry from getting something like a tattoo.</p>
    <p>We asked him to explain the situation and he stated "I was about to go down the big ride where you and other
        people
        are in a tube. I was going with my sons and right before we were sent down the worker
        splashed into our raft hitting me and my sons. My sons thought it was all funny,
        but I know the man had malicious intent with what he was doing."
        After hearing his story we feel for his pain over here at the Funyon and hope that he gets this whole deal
        settled and that worler gets fired.</p>
